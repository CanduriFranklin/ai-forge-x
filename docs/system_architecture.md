# AI ForgeX Suite - System Architecture

## Overview

AI ForgeX Suite is a comprehensive platform designed to provide transparent and customizable AI tools. The system reimagines popular AI applications with transparency and user control at their core, directly addressing the "black box" problem of many current AI implementations.

## Core Philosophy

The platform is built on two fundamental principles:
1. **Enhanced Transparency**: All AI operations provide clear explanations of how and why decisions are made
2. **User Customization**: Users have granular control over how the AI operates

## System Components

### 1. Backend Architecture

The backend of AI ForgeX Suite is built with Flask and consists of several key components:

```
backend/
├── app.py                 # Main Flask application
├── config.py              # Configuration settings
├── generate_image.py      # Standalone image generation script
└── requirements.txt       # Backend dependencies
```

#### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Main entry point, serves the frontend application |
| `/generate-image` | POST | Generates images using Stable Diffusion model |
| `/generate-text` | POST | Generates text using LLaMA model |
| `/generate` | POST | Generic endpoint for both text and image generation |
| `/generate-image-openai` | POST | Alternative image generation endpoint |
| `/execute-query` | POST | Executes queries and returns results with explanation |
| `/export-csv` | GET | Exports data in CSV format |
| `/export-json` | GET | Exports data in JSON format |
| `/execute-inference` | POST | Executes inference and returns results |

### 2. AI Models

The platform utilizes two primary AI models:

```
models/
├── explanation_model.py    # Text generation model wrapper
└── stable_diffusion.py     # Image generation model wrapper
```

#### Explanation Model
- Based on Meta's LLaMA 3.1 70B Instruct model
- Configured for transparent reasoning
- Provides detailed explanations of text generation process

#### Stable Diffusion Model
- Based on Stability AI's SDXL
- Configured for high-quality image generation
- Provides explanations of the image generation process

### 3. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using a Flask server for delivery:

```
frontend_flask/
├── app.py                  # Frontend Flask server
├── static/                 # Static assets
│   ├── Generate.css        # Styling
│   └── Generate.js         # Frontend logic
└── templates/              # HTML templates
    └── index.html          # Main application interface
```

#### User Interface Components
- Welcome screen with introduction
- AI Models interface with:
  - Image Generation section
  - Text Generation section
- Export functionality for saving results

## System Interactions

### Image Generation Flow

1. User inputs a text prompt describing the desired image
2. Request is sent to the `/generate-image` endpoint
3. Backend processes the request using the Stable Diffusion model
4. Image is generated and returned with explanation
5. Frontend displays the image and explanation to the user

### Text Generation Flow

1. User inputs a text prompt
2. Request is sent to the `/generate-text` endpoint
3. Backend processes the request using the LLaMA model
4. Generated text is returned with explanation
5. Frontend displays the text and explanation to the user

## Deployment Architecture

The application is designed to be deployed on Nebius Studio, with the following configuration:

- Backend service handling API requests
- Frontend service serving the user interface
- Direct integration with Nebius AI models for improved performance

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored as environment variables
- CORS protection is implemented for API endpoints
- Input validation is performed on all user inputs

## Scalability

The system is designed to scale horizontally by:
- Separating frontend and backend concerns
- Using stateless API design principles
- Leveraging cloud infrastructure for compute-intensive operations

## Future Architecture Expansion

The modular design allows for easy addition of:
- Additional AI models
- New visualization techniques for explanations
- Extended customization options
- User account management and result storage
